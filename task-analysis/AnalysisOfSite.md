# **Step One***
The user enters in [the url] (http://my.iit.edu/cp/home/check/post?js=true&java=false)
This send them to an anoying page that checks to see if they have Java support.
The one problem with this page is that that the [clicking here](http://my.iit.edu/jsp/misc/java_cook.jsp) link
will not give you an updated way to turn on JavaScript if it is turned off. We will not have this page in our final design.

# **Step Two**
The [Login Page](https://my.iit.edu/cp/home/displaylogin) is the page you are usually looking for when going to portal.
The main problem with this page is that the login part is not the focus of this page. This page 
is also not update often, which shows when exploring the page. Another problem is that you have to scroll 
and with a page like this it is very rare that a user will choose to go all the way to the bottom.

This is our current design fix:

# **Step Three**
Below is our Welcome Page. This and all pages after are inassible if you are not an IIT student or IIT factulty
The MyIIT portal will never win style awards. More importantly, it is hard to find **anything** quickly or 
without a lot of clicking.

# **Step Four**
This is the Academics Tab. This page isn't much different from the Welcome Page, ugly and messy.
It is also hard to tell what tab you are in and it can take a second to load after you click.
the link to the next step is the Add or Drop Class link.

# **Step Five**
The Add or Drop Page is one of the few pages that is "mobile fliendly"(notice quotations). 
This will not be in our final project we believe you should get the choice to choose the term
in the pervious step.

# **Step Six**
Another "Mobile Friendly" page. It would be fine if you only saw this page once a semsester,
however you have to enter in your pin every time you want to add or drop classes. 
Also notice that the pin is found on the welcome page. The Welcome Page was Step Number Three.
